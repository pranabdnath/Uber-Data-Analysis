Uber Data Analysis
Overview:
This project focuses on the analysis of Uber’s trip data, leveraging various statistical and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from ride-related information. The goal is to understand patterns in ride duration, fare amounts, distances, and temporal factors, such as peak hours and seasonal variations. By employing Python’s powerful libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project generates interactive visualizations and statistical reports that can help optimize Uber's service offerings and improve customer satisfaction.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Temporal Analysis: Identifying trends related to time, such as peak ride times, seasonal variations, and day-of-week patterns.

Categorical Analysis: Exploring categorical data related to ride purpose, ride category, and geographical patterns.

Data Visualization: Producing informative and easy-to-understand visualizations that highlight key trends, such as ride distribution by time of day, fare analysis, and the geographical spread of rides.

Correlation Analysis: Analyzing relationships between ride attributes to identify factors influencing ride duration and fare amounts.

Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

NumPy (for numerical operations)
